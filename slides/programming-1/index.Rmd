## Why code for data analysis?  

>- Automation
>- Documentation and reproducibility
>- Logical organization
>- Marketability!

>- A __high-level__, __object-oriented__, __general purpose__ programming language
>- _Interpreted_ rather than _compiled_
>- Rapidly becoming the language of choice for introductory programming courses around the world

## Why Python? (XKCD)

## Why Python?  

In Java, the classic "Hello World" program looks like this: 

```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }

}
```

Whereas in Python, you just type: 

```python
print("Hello World")
```

### Why Python? 

* Just ask these companies!

### Other options for data analysis

* R (<https://www.r-project.org/>): programming language for statistics, data analysis, and much more (and a personal favorite of mine)
* Julia (<http://julialang.org/>): relatively new language for technical computing that aims for high-level syntax and C-like speed

### The Jupyter Notebook

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/nature-demo/master/images/jupyter-logo.png" style="width: 700px; border: none;">

* Browser-based notebooks for _literate programming_
* Evolved out of the IPython project
* Supports multiple languages; "home language" is Python

---

### Literate programming

As defined by Donald Knuth: 

> Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation language... The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature, addressed to human beings rather than to a computer.

* Source: <http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/lp.html>

---

### Markdown

* Tool to convert plain text to HTML; used for literate programming in the Jupyter Notebook

Example: 

```
_This link_ is __truly__ must-see: [click here to view it!](http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/)
```

### Sage words before we get started...

### Numbers and strings

* At a basic level, Python can function like a calculator, or concatenate strings: 

```python
2 + 3
# 5

'x' + 'y'
# 'xy'

```

* _Object type_: the way in which the object is stored (e.g. float, integer, string)
* Python is a _dynamically typed_ language, which means that you don't need to explicitly supply the object type

---

### Variables

* In programming, a __variable__ is a reference to some other sort of information or quantity
* Variables are created through _assignment_

Example: 

```python
x = 1
x
# 1
```

---

## Strings

* Strings, or textual representations of data, have a series of special methods that allow for their manipulation

Example: 

```python
tcu = 'Texas Christian University'
tcu.swapcase()
# 'tEXAS cHRISTIAN uNIVERSITY'
```

---


## Lists

* Data structure in Python for storing multiple values; enclosed in brackets `[]`
* List elements do not need to all be of the same type (though you'll often want them to be)

Example list: `mylist = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]`

---

### Indexing and slicing

* Elements in Python can be accessed by position using __indexing__; covers characters in strings, objects in lists, and much more
* Python indexing starts at 0 - meaning that the first element is referenced with `0`, the second with `1`, and so forth
* __Slicing__: extract subset `a:b` starting with position `a` up to __but not including__ position `b`

---

### Indexing and slicing 

Example: 

```python
tcu[0]
# 'T'
tcu[6:15]
# 'Christian'
```
