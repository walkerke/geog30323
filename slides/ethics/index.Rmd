## Weekly exercise/extra credit

* This week's exercise: for _one_ of the three ethical scenarios that follow: 
  - Read the "reaction article" for that ethical scenario
  - Write up a short response (around 250 words) summarizing the article and your reactions to it
  
* For extra credit (equivalent in value to an "extra" weekly exercise): complete the weekly exercise prompt for _all three ethical scenarios._
