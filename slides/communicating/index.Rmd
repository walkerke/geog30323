## Course recap

* Thus far: we've focused on _exploratory data analysis_, which involves data wrangling, summarization, and visualization
* Your data analysis journey shouldn't stop here!  Topics to consider: 
    * _Explanatory_ vs. exploratory visualization
    * Statistics and data science
    * Data ethics and "big data" (next week)

---

### Communicating with data

* Once you've done all of the hard work wrangling your data, you'll want to communicate insights to others!
* This might include: 
    * Polished data products or reports
    * Models that can scale your insights

---

### Explanatory visualization

* We've largely worked to this point with _exploratory visualization_, which refers to internally-facing visualizations that help us reveal insights about our data
* Often, externally-facing data products will include _explanatory visualization_, which include a polished design and emphasize one or two key points

---

### Interactive reports

* Example: a data journalism article - or your Jupyter Notebook!
* Key distinction: your code, data exploration, etc. will likely be external to the report (this can vary depending on the context, however)

---

### Tableau

<img src="https://www.senturus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tableau-New-Logo-April-12-2016.jpg">

* Highly popular software for data visualization - both exploratory and explanatory
* Intuitive, drag-and-drop interface
* Key feature: the _dashboard_

---


### Data dashboards

* [Tableau public gallery](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/gallery?qt-overview_gallery=0)
* [Integration with Mapbox GL JS](https://www.ryanbaumann.com/blog/2016/11/21/tableau-with-next-nen-gl-maps-today)

### Demo: Tableau Public

* Let's work with a (cleaned) obesity dataset you'll be familiar with from earlier in the semester; download it at http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/data/overweight.csv

---

### Infographics

Obesity infographics:

### Are infographics useful?

* XKCD: https://xkcd.com/1273/

---

## Data Science

* __Data science__: new(ish) field that has emerged to address the challenges of working with modern data
* Fuses statistics, computer science, visualization, graphic design, and the humanities/social sciences/natural sciences...

---

### The data analysis process

---

### Visualization vs. modeling

Hadley Wickham (paraphrased): 

> Visualization can surprise you, but it doesnâ€™t scale well.
> Modeling scales well, but it doesn't (fundamentally) surprise.

---

### Statistical modeling

* What is the mathematical relationship between an outcome variable $Y$ and one or more other "predictor" variables $X_{1}...X_{n}$?
* Recall our use of `lmplot` in `seaborn` - `lm` stands for _linear model_

---

### Statistical modeling

The linear model: 

$$ Y = Xb + e $$

where $Y$ represents the outcome variable, $X$ is a matrix of predictors, $b$ represents the "parameters", and $e$ represents the errors, or "residuals"

* Linear models will not always be appropriate for modeling relationships between variables!

---

### Statistics in Python

* Substantial statistical functionality available in the `statsmodels` package, which installs with Anaconda

---

### Statistics in Python

Let's get an example ready: 

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

df = pd.read_csv('http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/data/texas_colleges.csv')
df['grad_rate'] = df.grad_rate * 100


```

---

### Linear regression

```python
f = smf.ols(formula = 'median_earn ~ grad_rate', data = df).fit()

f.summary()
```

---

### Multiple regression

```python
f2 = smf.ols(formula = 'median_earn ~ grad_rate + sat_avg', data = df).fit()
f2.summary()
```
---

### Residuals and fitted values

```python
df['fitted'] = f2.predict()
df['resid'] = f2.resid

```

---

### Machine learning

* "The science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed"
* Types of machine learning algorithms: _supervised_ and _unsupervised_
* Topics in machine learning: _classification_, _clustering_, _regression_

Visual introduction to machine learning: http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/

---

### In Python: `scikit-learn`

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

df = pd.read_csv('http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/data/dec8.csv', index_col = 'name')

df.head()
```

---

### Example: K-means clustering

```python
np.random.seed(1983)

km = KMeans(n_clusters = 7).fit(df)

df['clusters'] = km.labels_

# Check TCU's cluster
df.loc['Texas Christian University'] 

```

---

### Example: K-means clustering

```python
def glimpse_clusters(cluster_id):
    sub = df[df.clusters == cluster_id]
    print(sub.head(20))
    
```

---

### Example: nearest-neighbor search

```python
neigh = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors = 5)

# "Training" the model
neigh.fit(df) 

# Searching for neighbors
model = neigh.kneighbors(df, return_distance = False)
results = pd.DataFrame(model, columns = ['x1', 'x2', 'x3', 'x4', 'x5'])
merged = pd.merge(df.reset_index(), results, right_index = True, left_index = True)
```

---

### Example: nearest-neighbor search

```python
def find_neighbors(university): 
    d = merged[merged.name == university].reset_index()
    for x in ['x2', 'x3', 'x4', 'x5']: 
        idx = d.iloc[0][x]
        m = merged.loc[idx]
        print(m['name'])

```
