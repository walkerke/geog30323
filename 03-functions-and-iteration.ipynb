    "## Assignment 3: Functions, conditional statements, and iteration in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing your first Python assignment!  You'll be progressively building on those core skills throughout the semester.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's notebook, you are first going to learn about functions.  Functions are in some ways the bread-and-butter of Python programming.  They make code re-usable, as they allow you to apply your code in other contexts and circumstances.  You can think about functions this way: while variables store elements of your code (e.g. numbers, strings, lists), functions can store entire chunks of your code, which can in turn be re-used as necessary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions include a __definition__ and __parameters__, and are specified with `def` as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def myfunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3): \n",
    "    \"\"\"Your code goes here\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `def` command allows you to introduce a function definition.  You then specify the __parameters__ within parentheses following the function name, which are like variables that operate within your function.  A colon (`:`) then follows the parentheses, and the contents of the function are found beginning on the next line as an indented code block (more on indentation soon).  \n",
    "\n",
    "After you've defined the function, it can be __called__ by supplying __arguments__ to the parameters you've defined, again within parentheses.  For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myfunction(arg1, arg2, arg3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does this all work?  Let's try it out!\n",
    "\n",
    "At a very basic level, you can define a function without parameters - an _empty_ function.  This function will return whatever you've specified after it is called.  "

    "The R code, like in many languages, is organized in relation to the position of the curly braces, not the positioning of the code itself per se.  In Python, curly braces are not used in this capacity.  Instead, code is organized by indentation and whitespace.  Within a function definition, for example, the code to be executed by the function call should be indented with four spaces beneath the line that contains the `def` statement.  In many Python IDEs and the IPython Notebook, the software will already know this and indent your code accordingly.  In addition, the Tab key is set to be equivalent to the four spaces in most of these software packages as well.  Without proper indentation, however, your code will not run correctly. "

    "In the above lines of code, we used basic mathematical operators to see if conditions are true or false.  When we asked Python if 3 is greater than 2, it told us it was True; when we asked it if 2 is greater than 3, it said False.  Such true/false logic can be used with conditional statements in your code.  To do this, you'll often use __conditional operators__, which you'll be familiar with from basic mathematics, possibly with a couple exceptions.  Conditional operators in Python are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `<` Less than\n",

    "* `>=` Greater than or equal to\n",
    "* `==` Is equal to\n",
    "* `!=` Is not equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "As humans, we use conditional logic all of the time without really thinking about it.  For example, __if__ I am hungry, I'll probably go eat something; otherwise, I won't.  Such logic can be expressed in Python as a series of `if`, `elif` (which means _else if_), and `else` statements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to express this now in code in basic terms.  This is made-up code, so we don't need to understand everything, but here are the basics of it.  We define a function, `hungry`, that measures the biological/psychological properties that govern hunger reflexes in the human body.  We say, hypothetically, that a hunger index value encapsulating these properties that exceeds 100 means that a person is hungry; in turn, the function returns `True`.  Otherwise, it returns `False`.

While I am hungry, my level of hunger is not so debilitating that I am unable to work, and I know that finishing my work is a higher priority than eating at the moment.  In reality, there are countless conditions that influence whether we eat or not beyond simply how hungry we are.  For example - is there food accessible?  Are you in a place where it is socially acceptable to eat?  Perhaps you are at a party where pizza is available - you aren't hungry, but you eat it anyway?  Your brain processes all of this conditional logic at once as you make decisions, so we aren't always used to thinking explicitly about conditionals in such discrete ways.  However, to get a computer to understand this, you have to make it explicit in your code!\n",

However, they can also be produced by the built-in `range` function, which can simplify things for you significantly if you need to generate a long list of integers.  `range` has three parameters: `start`, which is the first integer you want to start with; `stop`, which is the first integer you __don't__ want to include, and `step`, which optionally specifies the integer interval.
