## Course recap

* Thus far: we've focused on _exploratory data analysis_, which involves data wrangling, summarization, and visualization
* Your data analysis journey shouldn't stop here!  Topics to consider: 
    * _Explanatory_ vs. exploratory visualization
    * Statistics and data science
    * Data ethics and "big data" 

---

### Communicating with data

* Once you've done all of the hard work wrangling your data, you'll want to communicate insights to others!
* This might include: 
    * Polished data products or reports
    * Models that can scale your insights

---

### Explanatory visualization

* We've largely worked to this point with _exploratory visualization_, which refers to internally-facing visualizations that help us reveal insights about our data
* Often, externally-facing data products will include _explanatory visualization_, which include a polished design and emphasize one or two key points

### Infographics

Obesity infographics: 

* [Example #1](http://visual.ly/72-million-obese-adults-united-states)
* [Example #2](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/41/4b/1b/414b1b7627feca460785a8eb749c2f38.jpg)

### Are infographics useful?

* XKCD: https://xkcd.com/1273/

---

### Interactive reports

* Example: a data journalism article - or your Jupyter Notebook!
* Key distinction: your code, data exploration, etc. will likely be external to the report (this can vary depending on the context, however)

### Data storytelling

### Why interactive visualization? 

* User is an _active participant_ rather than a _passive observer_
* Key points to consider: 
    * What are you visualizing? 
    * What is the purpose of your visualization? 
    * Who is your audience? 
    * In what format and venue will you be presenting the visualization?

### Interactive data journalism

### Interactivity in the Notebook

* The `ipywidgets` package allows you to build basic graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to explore your data in the Notebook
* How it works: supply a function to the `interact` function in `ipywidgets`

```python
from ipywidgets import interact

def add_five(x): 
    print(x + 5)

interact(add_five, x = (1, 100))

```

---

## Interactivity with plots

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

mx = pd.read_csv('http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/mexico.csv')

cols = ['mus09', 'pri10', 'sec10', 'ter10', 'gdp08']

def make_plot(x, y, title): 
    sns.lmplot(data = mx, x = x, y = y)
    plt.title(title)    
    
interact(make_plot, x = cols, y = cols, title = "Enter a plot title!")
```

---

### Widgets: not just for plots!

```python
def get_accidents(street_name): 
    part1 = 'https://data.fortworthtexas.gov/resource/kr8h-9zxd.json?streetname='
    api_call = part1 + street_name
    return pd.read_json(api_call)

def get_street(street = ['BERRY', 'UNIVERSITY', 'ROSEDALE']): 
    df = get_accidents(street)
    return df.head()
    
interact(get_street) 
```

---

## Ipywidgets fundamentals

Arguments used in `interact()` correspond to the following: 

* A __boolean__ (`True` or `False`) returns a __checkbox__
* A __string__ returns a __text input__
* A __number__ (integer or float) returns a __slider__
* A __tuple of numbers__ (start, end, step size) returns a __range slider__
* A __list__ returns a __drop-down menu__

Experiment with the functions you've written this semester!

### Interactive visualization and the web

* Analytical workflows have become increasingly connected to the web - or even completely web-based
* Interactive data visualization: graphics not just _on_ the web, but _of_ the web

### Interactive visualization in Python

* [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)

* [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html)

* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)

---

## Altair example

```python
import altair as alt

alt.Chart(mx).mark_circle(size = 60).encode(
    x = "pri10",
    y = "mus09",
    tooltip = ["name", "mus09", "pri10"]
).interactive()
```

### Tableau

<img src="https://www.senturus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tableau-New-Logo-April-12-2016.jpg">

* Highly popular software for data visualization - both exploratory and explanatory
* Intuitive, drag-and-drop interface
* Key feature: the _dashboard_

### Data dashboards

* [Tableau public gallery](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/gallery?qt-overview_gallery=0)
* [Integration with Mapbox](https://public.tableau.com/views/TheTurtle/Tester?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link&:showVizHome=no#1)
