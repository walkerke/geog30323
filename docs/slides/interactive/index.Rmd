## Interactive visualization

* Thus far: you've learned how to create static charts with `pandas` and `seaborn`
* Our focus now turns to _interactive charts_

### Interactive visualization and the web

* Analytical workflows have become increasingly connected to the web - or even completely web-based
* Interactive data visualization: graphics not just _on_ the web, but _of_ the web

### The past: Java and Flash

### The future: WebGL

### Why interactive visualization? 

* User is an _active participant_ rather than a _passive observer_
* Key points to consider: 
    * What are you visualizing? 
    * What is the purpose of your visualization? 
    * Who is your audience? 
    * In what format and venue will you be presenting the visualization?  
    
---

### New libraries!

* We're going to usesome new Python libraries to chart interactively.  They include: 
    * `ipywidgets`: a package for interactive mini-apps in the Jupyter Notebook
    * `plotly`: produces D3.js charts using Python, and can convert your Python charts as well
    * `cufflinks`: binds `pandas` to `plotly`

* In CoCalc, interactivity only available in the __Classical Notebook__: change the format to get this code to work
    
---

### Let's get some data!

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

mx = pd.read_csv('http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/mexico.csv')
```

---

### Our basic plot

```python
mx.plot(kind = 'scatter', x = 'pri10', y = 'mus09')
```
<img src=img/basic.png>

---

### Interactivity in the Notebook

* In CoCalc: interactivity requires the __Classical__ rather than the __Modern__ notebook
* Use the command `%matplotlib notebook`, and your plot becomes interactive!

```python
%matplotlib notebook
mx.plot(kind = 'scatter', x = 'pri10', y = 'mus09')
```

---

### Interactivity in the Notebook

* The `ipywidgets` package allows you to build basic graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to explore your data in the Notebook
* How it works: supply a function to the `interact` function in `ipywidgets`

```python
from ipywidgets import interact

def add_five(x): 
    print(x + 5)

interact(add_five, x = (1, 100))

```

---

## Interactivity with plots

```python
cols = ['mus09', 'pri10', 'sec10', 'ter10', 'gdp08']

def make_plot(x, y, title): 
    sns.lmplot(data = mx, x = x, y = y)
    plt.title(title)    
    
interact(make_plot, x = cols, y = cols, title = "Enter a plot title!")
```

---

### Widgets: not just for plots!

```python
def get_accidents(street_name): 
    part1 = 'https://data.fortworthtexas.gov/resource/kr8h-9zxd.json?streetname='
    api_call = part1 + street_name
    return pd.read_json(api_call)

def get_street(street = ['BERRY', 'UNIVERSITY', 'ROSEDALE']): 
    df = get_accidents(street)
    return df.head()
    
interact(get_street) 
```

---

### Plotly

* Plotly: Web-based platform for interactive charting; 
* Includes both offline components (works in the Jupyter Notebook) and an online cloud/web GUI at  https://plot.ly/

---

### Plotly in Python

* The Plotly Python package can convert your `matplotlib` plots to Plotly charts!

```python
import plotly.offline as py
py.init_notebook_mode()

mx.plot(kind = 'scatter', x = 'pri10', y = 'mus09')
fig = plt.gcf() # "Get current figure"
py.iplot_mpl(fig)
```

---

### Plotly and `seaborn`

* Plotly can convert some `seaborn` plots - though the styling will not always carry over

```python
sns.distplot(mx.pri10)
f = plt.gcf()
py.iplot_mpl(f)
```

---

## Cufflinks

* New Python library to create Plotly plots directly from `pandas` data frames!
* Simply use `iplot` instead of `plot`!

```python
import cufflinks as cf
cf.go_offline()

mx.iplot(kind = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', x = 'pri10', 
         y = 'mus09', text = 'name', colors = 'green', 
         xTitle = '% of workforce in primary sector', 
         yTitle = 'Out-migration rate to the United States')
```
---

## Cufflinks

```python
mx[['pri10', 'gdp08', 'mus09']].scatter_matrix()
```

---

## Cufflinks!

```python
mx.iplot(kind = 'scatter3d', x = 'mus09', y = 'gdp08', 
         z = 'pri10', mode = 'markers', text = 'name')
```

---

## The Plotly cloud

* Plotly plots are fully editable and saveable in the cloud if you have a Plotly account; click "Export to plot.ly" on your chart
* Demo

---

## Plotly.py

* More advanced visualizations can be developed with the Plotly Python library
* How it works: specify a list of graph objects to be plotted, along with layout options (optional) to customize the chart appearance; supply to the `iplot()` function to view in the Jupyter Notebook

---

## 3-dimensional plots

```python
import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objs as go

arr = np.random.randn(10, 10)

data = [go.Surface(z = arr)]

py.iplot(data)
```

---

### Widgets and range sliders

* Step 1: Get the data

```python
from pandas_datareader import wb

ind = "SP.DYN.TFRT.IN"

tfr = wb.download(country = "all", indicator = ind, start = 1960, end = 2013)

tfr.reset_index(inplace = True)
```

---

### Widgets and range sliders

* Step 2: build the plotting function

```python
def tfr_plot(country1, country2, country3):
    countries = [country1, country2, country3]    
    subset = tfr[tfr.country.isin(countries)]
    subset_wide = subset.pivot(index = "year", columns = "country", 
                               values = "SP.DYN.TFRT.IN")
    plot_data = [
        go.Scatter(x = subset_wide.index, 
                  y = subset_wide[country], 
                  name = country, 
                  mode = "lines")
        for country in countries
    ]
    plot_layout = go.Layout(title = "Total fertility rate", 
                           xaxis = dict(rangeslider = dict()), 
                           yaxis = dict(title = "TFR"))
    fig = dict(data = plot_data, layout = plot_layout)
    py.iplot(fig)
```

---

### Widgets and range sliders

* Step 3: interact with the plot

```python
country_list = list(tfr.country.unique())
    
interact(tfr_plot, country1 = country_list, 
         country2 = country_list, country3 = country_list)
```

---

## Saving your plots

* If you have a Plotly account, you can save plots with the default styling to Plotly's cloud by clicking "Export to plot.ly"
* Otherwise: plots can be saved as standalone HTML outside of the notebook

---

### Saving your plots (cufflinks example)

```python
myplot = mx.iplot(kind = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', x = 'pri10', 
         y = 'mus09', text = 'name', colors = 'green', 
         xTitle = '% of workforce in primary sector', 
         yTitle = 'Out-migration rate to the United States', 
         asFigure = True)
         
py.plot(myplot, filename = 'mexico_plot.html')
```
