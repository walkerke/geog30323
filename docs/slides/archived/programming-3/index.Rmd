## Iteration

* At your jobs, you will often need to repeat the same task over and over!
* From your textbook: "Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly."
* Solution: make the computer do it with _iteration_

---

## Loops

* Loops are operators that tell the computer to repeat an action a given number of times
* Common loops: 
    - `for`: Repeats an action over a series of items
    - `while`: Repeats an action until a given condition is satisfied

* Important note: loops, like functions, must obey whitespace rules!

---

## The `for` loop

* `for` repeats an action __for__ every element in an object
* Example: 

```python
for character in 'Kyle': 
   print("Give me a " + character + "!")

Give me a K!
Give me a y!
Give me a l!
Give me a e!
```

---

### How `for` works

So what is going on here?  

1. The `for` loop looks at what it will iterate through - in this case it is a string, `Kyle`
2. We are referring to each element of our string, `Kyle`, as `character`.  
3. The loop evaluates the expression passed to the `print` function __for__ each `character` in `Kyle` successively

So the `for` loop is equivalent to: 

```python
print("Give me a K!")
print("Give me a y!")
print("Give me a l!")
print("Give me a e!")
```

---

### The `while` loop

* `while` repeats an action until a given condition is satisfied
* Example: 

```python
i = 5

while i > 0: 
    print(str(i) + "...")
    i = i - 1

print("Blast-off!")
5...
4...
3...
2...
1...
Blast-off!
```

---

### How `while` works

1. We define a counter, `i`, that we set to 5 before running the loop
2. __While__ the value of `i` is greater than `0`, we tell Python to evaluate the `print` function
3. With each run of the loop, we subtract `1` from `i`
4. When `i` is equal to `0`, we exit the loop and print `"Blast-off"` to the console

Beware of the infinite `while` loop!

---

## Conditional logic

* However - what if we don't want to do the same thing every time we run a loop?  Or a function, for that matter? 
* Answer: __conditional logic__

---

### Conditional logic

* Conditional statements in Python: `if`, `elif`, and `else`
* Conditional operators: 
    * `<` Less than
    * `>` Greater than
    * `<=` Less than or equal to
    * `>=` Greater than or equal to
    * `==` Is equal to
    * `!=` Is not equal to
* Booleans: `True` and `False`
* Boolean operators: `and`, `or`, & `not`

---

### Conditional logic in Python

* Example: 

```python
mylist = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
for number in mylist: 
    if number > 7: 
        print(str(number) + " is greater than 7!")
    else: 
        print(str(number) + " is less than 7!")

2 is less than 7!
4 is less than 7!
6 is less than 7!
8 is greater than 7!
10 is greater than 7!
12 is greater than 7!
```

---

### Conditional logic in functions

* When writing functions, you'll rely heavily on conditional statements 

```python
def is_even(x): 
    if x % 2 == 0: 
        return(True)
    else: 
        return(False)

is_even(8)
True
is_even(99)
False
```

---

## Object-oriented programming

* Programming paradigm in which language is oriented around data objects
* In Python, "everything is an object!"

---

## Classes

* A __class__ is a special type of Python object that itself can have attributes and methods
* Associated with object-oriented programming in Python

---

### How classes work

```python
class Employee:
    company = "TCU"
    
    def __init__(self, name, salary): 
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary

# Let's create a class instance
doug = Employee(name = "Doug", salary = 50000) 

doug.company

'TCU' # the result
```

---

### Class attributes and methods

* Class __attributes__: attributes that are associated with a given class
    + Attributes can be associated with the __class__ or class __instances__
* Class __methods__: functions associated with the class

```python

def get_raise(self, raise_amount):
    self.salary = self.salary + raise_amount
    
doug.get_raise(5000)
    
```
