## Functions

* If you find yourself doing the same thing frequently, it can be tedious to write the same code over and over! 
* As such, you should use __functions__ to make your code re-usable

---

* Functions are defined with a `def` statement followed by a colon (`:`) 
* They include a series of __parameters__ to which you supply __arguments__, which are like variables that operate within your function: 

```python
def myfunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3): 
    """Your code goes here"""
    
# "Calling" the function: 

myfunction(arg1, arg2, arg3)

```

---

## Empty functions

* At a basic level, a function can be defined without parameters

Example: 

```python
def drwalker(): 
    print("The best professor!")

drwalker()
# The best professor!
```

---

## Functions and parameters

__Parameters__ are components of your function that can vary based on user input.  Example: 

```python
def make_big(x):
    print(x.upper())

make_big('abcdefg')
# ABCDEFG
make_big('the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog')
# THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG
x = 'hijklmn'
make_big(x)
# HIJKLMN
```

## The `return` statement

* The output of functions can be assigned to variables if a `return` statement is provided

Example: 

```python
def add_five(x):
    return x + 5

y = add_five(10)
y
# 15
```

---

### Python and whitespace

* Python code is organized by __indentation__ and __whitespace__
* After function definitions, code should be indented with __four spaces__. In the Jupyter Notebook (and other Python development environments), the Tab key represents four spaces, and it will indent your code automatically
* Code that is not indented properly will cause an error

```python
def add_six(x):
return x + 6
    
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    return x + 6
         ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

---

### Comments

* _Comments_, preceded by a hash (`#`), can be included in your code but are not run
* _Commenting_ your code is useful for describing what you are doing, or keeping experimental/old code you don't want to run during the development process

```python
# The function 'divide_by_two' divides any number by two  <-- a comment

def divide_by_two(number):
    return number / 2

# This didn't work - remember whitespace issues

# def divide_by_two(number):
# return number / 2
```
---

### Docstrings

* _Docstrings_ can be used to describe what functions do
* Docstrings are enclosed in triple double quotes (`"""   """`) and are placed on the line following the function definition

```python
def concat_numbers(num1, num2):
    """
    Return a concatenated string from two numbers.  
    
    Parameters: 
    -----------
    
    num1: The first number you'd like to concatenate
    
    num2: The second number you'd like to concatenate   
    
    """
    
    return str(num1) + str(num2)
```

---

### Ordering and named arguments

Arguments can be supplied to functions in two ways: 

* "Unnamed" in the order specified
* "Named" in any order.  Be careful, however, if you mix the two!

```python
concat_numbers(7, 3)
# '73'
concat_numbers(num2 = 7, num1 = 3)
# '37'
concat_numbers(7, num2 = 3)
# '73'
# concat_numbers(num2 = 7, 3)
  File "<stdin>", line 1
SyntaxError: non-keyword arg after keyword arg
```

---

## Scripts

* Python _script_: organized collection of code stored in a text file with a `.py` suffix
* Generally, scripts authored in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE)

---

### Scripts

* In IDEs, you can document workflows with scripts and run them interactively: 

<img src=img/script.png style="width: 800px">

---

### Scripts

* Scripts can also be run from the command line, e.g. `python myscript.py`

* Alternatively, scripts can be used in Python _modules_ and _packages_

---

## Modules and packages

* _Module_: file containing variables, functions, etc. that can be _imported_ into a Python session with the `import` statement
* _Package_: directory of modules that perform similar tasks (e.g. data visualization, statistics, etc.)
* Thousands upon thousands of Python packages available - that do just about anything!

---

## Creating your own module

Let's try this out!

---

### The Python namespace

* When you declare variables, define functions, import modules, etc., you are adding objects to the _Python namespace_
* To remove objects from the Python namespace, use the `del` statement


---

### Imports and the namespace 

* Imported modules can be referenced in multiple ways: 

```python
# All of these are equivalent

import mymodule
mymodule.add_abc(mymodule.tcu)

import mymodule as mm

mm.add_abc(mm.tcu)

from mymodule import *

add_abc(tcu)
```

---

## Built-in packages

* Many packages are included in `stdlib`, the standard library that ships with Python
* Popular modules: `re` for regular expressions; `os` for operating system functions; `random` for random-number generation; and many more.  Full list: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/>

---

## Conda

* The Anaconda Python installation ships with over 330 packages for scientific computing
* New packages added to Anaconda can be installed with `conda install` from the command line
* To update all your packages, run `conda update --all`

---

## PyPI and pip

* Third-party Python packages are generally found at the Python Package Index (PyPI): https://pypi.python.org/pypi
* Generally, these packages can be installed from the command line with `pip`, the recommended tool for installing packages from PyPI
* Example usage: `pip install newpackage`
* To upgrade packages, use the `--upgrade` option: `pip install --upgrade newpackage`

* Our course materials are hosted on GitHub - so what is GitHub, exactly?  
* Let's take a tour: <https://github.com/>

## Open-source software

* Developed, in large part, by the user community
* Source code is _open_
* Software is generally free to purchase and update; some services under a "freemium" model
* Reliant on the user community for support
