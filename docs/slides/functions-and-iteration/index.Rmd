## Functions

* If you find yourself doing the same thing frequently, it can be tedious to write the same code over and over! 
* As such, you should use __functions__ to make your code re-usable

---

* Functions are defined with a `def` statement followed by a colon (`:`) 
* They include a series of __parameters__ to which you supply __arguments__, which are like variables that operate within your function: 

```python
def myfunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3): 
    """Your code goes here"""
    
# "Calling" the function: 

myfunction(arg1, arg2, arg3)

```

---

## Empty functions

* At a basic level, a function can be defined without parameters

Example: 

```python
def drwalker(): 
    print("The best professor!")

drwalker()
# The best professor!
```

---

## Functions and parameters

__Parameters__ are components of your function that can vary based on user input.  Example: 

```python
def make_big(x):
    print(x.upper())

make_big('abcdefg')
# ABCDEFG
make_big('the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog')
# THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG
x = 'hijklmn'
make_big(x)
# HIJKLMN
```

## The `return` statement

* The output of functions can be assigned to variables if a `return` statement is provided

Example: 

```python
def add_five(x):
    return x + 5

y = add_five(10)
y
# 15
```

---

### Python and whitespace

* Python code is organized by __indentation__ and __whitespace__
* After function definitions, code should be indented with __four spaces__. In the Jupyter Notebook (and other Python development environments), the Tab key represents four spaces, and it will indent your code automatically
* Code that is not indented properly will cause an error

```python
def add_six(x):
return x + 6
    
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    return x + 6
         ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

---

### Comments

* _Comments_, preceded by a hash (`#`), can be included in your code but are not run
* _Commenting_ your code is useful for describing what you are doing, or keeping experimental/old code you don't want to run during the development process

```python
# The function 'divide_by_two' divides any number by two  <-- a comment

def divide_by_two(number):
    return number / 2

# This didn't work - remember whitespace issues

# def divide_by_two(number):
# return number / 2
```
---

### Docstrings

* _Docstrings_ can be used to describe what functions do
* Docstrings are enclosed in triple double quotes (`"""   """`) and are placed on the line following the function definition

```python
def concat_numbers(num1, num2):
    """
    Return a concatenated string from two numbers.  
    
    Parameters: 
    -----------
    
    num1: The first number you'd like to concatenate
    
    num2: The second number you'd like to concatenate   
    
    """
    
    return str(num1) + str(num2)
```

---

### Ordering and named arguments

Arguments can be supplied to functions in two ways: 

* "Unnamed" in the order specified
* "Named" in any order.  Be careful, however, if you mix the two!

```python
concat_numbers(7, 3)
# '73'
concat_numbers(num2 = 7, num1 = 3)
# '37'
concat_numbers(7, num2 = 3)
# '73'
# concat_numbers(num2 = 7, 3)
  File "<stdin>", line 1
SyntaxError: non-keyword arg after keyword arg
```

---

## Iteration

---

## Iteration

* At your jobs, you will often need to repeat the same task over and over!
* From your textbook: "Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly."
* Solution: make the computer do it with _iteration_

---

## Loops

* Loops are operators that tell the computer to repeat an action a given number of times
* Common loops: 
    - `for`: Repeats an action over a series of items
    - `while`: Repeats an action until a given condition is satisfied

* Important note: loops, like functions, must obey whitespace rules!

---

## The `for` loop

* `for` repeats an action __for__ every element in an object
* Example: 

```python
for character in "Kyle": 
   print("Give me a " + character + "!")

Give me a K!
Give me a y!
Give me a l!
Give me a e!
```

---

### How `for` works

So what is going on here?  

1. The `for` loop looks at what it will iterate through - in this case it is a string, `"Kyle"`
2. We are referring to each element of our string, `"Kyle"`, as `character`.  
3. The loop evaluates the expression passed to the `print` function __for__ each `character` in `"Kyle"` successively

So the `for` loop is equivalent to: 

```python
print("Give me a K!")
print("Give me a y!")
print("Give me a l!")
print("Give me a e!")
```

---

### The `while` loop

* `while` repeats an action until a given condition is satisfied
* Example: 

```python
i = 5

while i > 0: 
    print(str(i) + "...")
    i = i - 1

print("Blast-off!")
5...
4...
3...
2...
1...
Blast-off!
```

---

### How `while` works

1. We define a counter, `i`, that we set to 5 before running the loop
2. __While__ the value of `i` is greater than `0`, we tell Python to evaluate the `print` function
3. With each run of the loop, we subtract `1` from `i`
4. When `i` is equal to `0`, we exit the loop and print `"Blast-off"` to the console

Beware of the infinite `while` loop!

---

## Conditional logic

* However - what if we don't want to do the same thing every time we run a loop?  Or a function, for that matter? 
* Answer: __conditional logic__

---

### Conditional logic

* Conditional statements in Python: `if`, `elif`, and `else`
* Conditional operators: 
    * `<` Less than
    * `>` Greater than
    * `<=` Less than or equal to
    * `>=` Greater than or equal to
    * `==` Is equal to
    * `!=` Is not equal to
* Booleans: `True` and `False`
* Boolean operators: `and`, `or`, & `not`

---

### Conditional logic in Python

* Example: 

```python
mylist = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
for number in mylist: 
    if number > 7: 
        print(str(number) + " is greater than 7!")
    else: 
        print(str(number) + " is less than 7!")

2 is less than 7!
4 is less than 7!
6 is less than 7!
8 is greater than 7!
10 is greater than 7!
12 is greater than 7!
```

---

### Conditional logic in functions

* When writing functions, you'll rely heavily on conditional statements 

```python
def is_even(x): 
    if x % 2 == 0: 
        return(True)
    else: 
        return(False)

is_even(8)
True
is_even(99)
False
```
