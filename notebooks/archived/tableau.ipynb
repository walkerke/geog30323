    "## Assignment 12: Building a dashboard with Tableau\n",
    "\n",
    "You've made it to your last assignment of the semester! In this assignment, you're going to learn how to \"put everything together\" into the form of an interactive _dashboard_.  Dashboards are applications that may include multiple charts, which in some cases are configured to interact with one another.  While there _are_ many ways to build dashboards, including in Python, one of the most popular software applications for these types of visualizations is Tableau.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau, like other software products we've discussed this semester, employs a tiered pricing structure.  We'll be working in this assignment with [Tableau Public](http://www.tableau.com/products/public), a free version of Tableau.  Tableau comes in other flavors; Tableau Desktop is the core commercial version, and Tableau Server is an enterprise version that can be deployed from a company's server.  Tableau Public includes most of the features of the paid versions; the key caveat is that your visualizations must be saved to Tableau's public cloud and shared publicly; private visualizations are only available in the paid versions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau Public is installed on the computers in our classroom.  If you are working on your own computer, you can install it from https://public.tableau.com/s/download; I'd recommend this for completing the assignment.  All you need to provide is your email address to get this done.  However, at this point I'd also recommend creating a Tableau Public profile - this will be necessary for the assignment as well.  From https://public.tableau.com/s/, click the \"SIGN IN\" button in the upper right of the screen; next, click the \"Create one now for free\" link to create a profile.  Once you've activated your profile, you'll find an available link to download the Tableau Public application as well.  \n",

    "Certainly, there are advantages and disadvantages to each plot; for example, the map shows geographic clustering (e.g. high values in the south of Mexico), whereas the plot more clearly displays quantitative differences between states.  A solution to this could be to include both visualizations in a report (like in a Jupyter Notebook!) to show the data in different ways.  However: there are also ways to include both the map and the dot plot in the same graphic - and make the two visuals interact with each other!  Creating charts like this is one of Tableau's strengths - and something you'll learn how to do in this assignment.  \n",

    "### Mapping Mexican states in Tableau\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, download the data for this assignment from the following link: http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/mexico.csv, and save it somewhere where you'll know how to find it.  Next, launch the Tableau Public application.  You should see something appear like the graphic below: \n",

    "Drag and drop your Mexico CSV file onto the application, and Tableau will load it for you.  You'll get a preview of your data as it will appear in Tableau; at this point, you can make some modifications to the columns if you'd like, such as renaming them; however, let's proceed by clicking \"Sheet 1\" at the bottom of the screen. \n",

    "Your columns on the left hand side of the screen are divided into __Dimensions__, which refer to the text values in your data, and __Measures__, which are numeric values.  Building charts in Tableau is based on a drag-and-drop interface, in which you will move these column names into the right spots for building a visualization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As we're going to make a map first, we need to identify the geographic information in our dataset.  Individual states can be identified by their names; Tableau includes a host of built-in geographic outlines that can be matched to values in CSV data like our data on Mexico.  Follow these steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, right-click your \"Name\" column, and choose __Geographic Role__.  Change this to \"State/Province.\"  \n",
    "2. Next, drag and drop your \"Name\" column in the larger area that reads _Drop field here_.  Tableau will attempt to make a map, but won't be able to locate the states at first.  \n",
    "3. Look for the grey box in the lower-right hand corner of the screen that says \"32 unknown.\"  Click, and choose \"Edit Locations.\"  \n",
    "4. Change the value in the \"Country/Region\" drop-down menu to __Mexico__.  The states should now match, so click __OK__.  You should now see a map of Mexico, with dots!  \n",
    "5. Look for the \"Marks\" card to the left of the map, and change the drop-down menu to \"Filled Map.\"  You'll see the states of Mexico appear as polygons!\n",

We'll be mapping primary sector employment by state, so locate the \"Pri10\" column from the __Measures__ section and drag and drop it on the __Color__ icon in the __Marks__ card.  Your map's states should now become colored based on their values for primary sector employment, using a default continuous sequential color ramp. To change the colors of your map, right-click the color ramp and select __Edit Colors__; you can then choose a variety of color palettes from the drop down menu provided, and switch to a binned color scheme by checking the \"Stepped Color\" box, if you prefer.

    "You've now re-created the two charts from our scenario in Tableau.  Your next step is to build a visualization that incorporates both of these chart types - the map and the dot plot - and enables communication between the two.  To do this, you'll build a __dashboard__, which is one of Tableau's key strengths.  Dashboards are visualizations that can include multiple charts which incorporate __Actions__, or methods that govern interactivity when the user interacts with the visualization.  \n",

These options govern how your dashboard layout will appear.  You'll ultimately want to modify these options to accommodate the size of the visualization you want.  I would like you to make sure that the \"New objects\" option is set to \"Tiled\", and choose \"Automatic\" from the __Size__ drop-down menu, which means that your dashboard size will be responsive to the size of your screen.  \n",

    "Drag and drop your Sheet 1, the Mexico map, onto the dashboard.  Your map should fill up the screen.  Right-click the sheet title in the visualization (it should say \"Sheet 1\" above your map), and select __Hide Title__.  Next, look for your map legend - it should default to the upper-right corner of your screen.  Click it to highlight it, and then look for the corresponding box in the lower-left corner of your Tableau application.  Check the box for \"Floating\" then move the legend somewhere on your visualization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, drag and drop your Sheet 2, the dot plot, on the dashboard.  You'll be able to put it on any side.  If you make the chart floating, like you did with the legend, you can start to get creative in where you position your chart.  Additionally, you can drag and drop additional new objects onto your dashboard as you'd like.  For example, if you set the \"New objects\" option to \"Floating\", you can add a Text box, an image, or an embedded web page.  I've created an example layout below that includes a title and a logo for INEGI, the data source for this assignment.  This is by no means the only or best way to do things!  Spend some time exploring the options and modifying the layout of your dashboard as you see fit.  \n",

    "You may notice that your dashboard appears slightly different on the web than it did on your computer's monitor; this will depend on the size of your monitor and how you configured the chart.  When designing in Tableau, it is important to size your elements in a way that makes sense for your ultimate output.  For example - the dashboard I designed above works well on my wide computer monitor; however, when embedded within another website, my elements get clumped together.  Fortunately, you can experiment with different dashboard sizes, and view how your layouts will appear in different contexts.  Designing a Tableau dashboard takes time to get it just right!  However - you can create a full-screen website with your Tableau dashboard using the embed code, and modifying it slightly; if you are interested in doing this, [read this post by Allan Walker](http://allanwalkerit.tumblr.com/post/132943293067/responsive-dashboards-in-tableau).  \n",
