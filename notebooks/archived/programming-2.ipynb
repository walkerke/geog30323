    "## Programming II: Functions and modules in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing your first Python assignment!  You'll be progressively building on those core skills throughout the semester.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's notebook, you are going to learn about functions and modules.  Functions are in some ways the bread-and-butter of Python programming.  They make code re-usable, as they allow you to apply your code in other contexts and circumstances.  You can think about functions this way: while variables store elements of your code (e.g. numbers, strings, lists), functions can store entire chunks of your code, which can in turn be re-used as necessary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions include a __definition__ and __parameters__, and are specified with `def` as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def myfunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3): \n",
    "    \"\"\"Your code goes here\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `def` command allows you to introduce a function definition.  You then specify the __parameters__ within parentheses following the function name, which are like variables that operate within your function.  A colon (`:`) then follows the parentheses, and the contents of the function are found beginning on the next line as an indented code block (more on indentation soon).  \n",
    "\n",
    "After you've defined the function, it can be __called__ by supplying __arguments__ to the parameters you've defined, again within parentheses.  For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myfunction(arg1, arg2, arg3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does this all work?  Let's try it out!\n",
    "\n",
    "At a very basic level, you can define a function without parameters - an _empty_ function.  This function will return whatever you've specified after it is called.  "

In Python, curly braces are not used in this capacity.  Instead, code is organized by indentation and whitespace.  Within a function definition, for example, the code to be executed by the function call should be indented with four spaces beneath the line that contains the `def` statement.  In many Python IDEs and the IPython Notebook, the software will already know this and indent your code accordingly.  In addition, the Tab key is set to be equivalent to the four spaces in most of these software packages as well.  Without proper indentation, however, your code will not run correctly. "
