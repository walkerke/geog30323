The notebooks will consist of brief tutorials that reiterate some of the concepts you've learned in class, along with some basic exercises that test you on some of these skills.  Notebooks will be assigned most weeks during the semester, and are due the following week.  "

Python is an example of an _interpreted_ programming language, which means that it is converted on-the-fly to machine code - that is, code your computer can understand.  This can make development simpler, but generally executes slower than _compiled_ languages, in which the source code must be run through a compiler before it is executed.  This additional step, however, can speed up execution substantially, which is why compiled languages like Java, C, or C++ are sometimes preferred for software development.  \n",

To choose a Python or Markdown cell, simply change the option from the drop-down menu at the top of the screen.  To \"run\" the contents of your cell, click the \"run cell\" button from the menu at the top of the screen, or use the keyboard shortcut Shift+Enter.  \n",
