    "## Data wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last two notebooks and in the first take-home examination, we've gotten a chance to explore our data with both basic statistical methods and different types of data visualization.  While this is a key part of the data analysis process, datasets need to be in the right format before analysts can start drawing meaningful conclusions.  The process of preparing data for analysis is called __data wrangling__, and often takes the bulk of an analysts' time during a data project.  Possible issues might include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Missing data or problematic/incorrect values in a dataset; \n",
    "* Data are formatted incorrectly, preventing the analyst from working with the data in the right way; \n",
    "* Data are spread across multiple files or data tables; \n",
    "* Data are in the wrong \"shape\" for analysis and visualization\n",
    "* All of the above, in varying capacities!\n",
    "\n",
    "A major reason why you are learning to work with `pandas` in this course is because it can flexibly handle all of these tasks.  In this notebook, we'll be going over some basic examples of how this works, which you'll then put into practice with the Exercises at the end.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be working primarily with the US Department of Education's College Scorecard dataset, which we are all very familiar with at this point from lecture and the first take-home examination.  As we did in class, let's read in the full dataset with the code below.  "

At this point, while you might not know yet what insights are contained in the data, you will have some sense of the research questions that you are interested in.  As your research questions don't likely require all 122 columns, you can safely restrict your dataset to only those columns that you need for your analysis.  Our core research question is as follows: \n",

For example, had I assigned the results of the subsetting operation back to `full`, and I later decided that I needed an additional column from the original data frame, I'd need to read the whole thing in again rather than just add a column name to the list `keep`.  Python will hold all of our data `in memory`, so it will be accessible to us throughout our Python session; given that our data are relatively small, this won't cause us any problems.  Bigger data workflows might require different methods, however.  \n",

For example, I don't really want to hit Caps Lock or the Shift key every time I am typing out column names, but my column names are capitalized.  Our column names in our data frame are simply a list of strings, which we've learned how to work with already with string methods.  As such, check this out: "

Dictionaries, or `dict` objects as they are often called, are enclosed by curly braces (`{}`) and are made up of __key/value pairs__.  In turn, they can really come in handy when working with paired values; we may return to them later in the semester.  \n",

We're interested in comparing primarily bachelor's-granting universities, which have the code of `3`; in turn, we want to tell `pandas` to keep only those rows where the `preddeg` column is equal to 3.  First, let's check our `dtypes` to see if the columns is formatted as a string or number: "

In this case, we want all of those rows for which the value of the `preddeg` column is equal to 3.  Let's create a new dataframe, called `ug` for undergraduate, from this expression.  "

It looks like primarily we've returned Jewish _yeshivas_ as well as a few graduate colleges - e.g. New England College of Optometry which is designated as a bachelor's granting institution but has no undergraduates - that appear to have been mis-coded.  This reveals why careful inspection of your data is important.  Missing values often aren't at random, but instead may be systematic or clustered amongst a particular type of record in your dataset.  Additionally, it looks like we've uncovered some errors in the original data as well.   \n",

I can do this a couple different ways.

    "We can get a clear sense here of the variations of the distributions between the groups.  While the mean percentage of undergraduates above 25 at public non-profits was below that of private non-profits, it appears as though the median for private non-profits is lower; there is simply a longer tail of private non-profits with large proportions of their student bodies above 25.  For private for-profits, the distribution is quite evident - with the median value above 70 percent and the peak of the density curve above 80 percent.  \n",

We'll learn more about this in a couple weeks when we focus on data visualization; however we can take a look right now.  The `factorplot` function in `seaborn` allows you to split categorical plots such as point (the default), box, violin, bar, or strip plots into separate smaller charts, to facilitate comparisons across groups.  \n",
