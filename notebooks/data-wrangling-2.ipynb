    "## Assignment 8: Wrangling data from APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous assignment gave you some experience with the data wrangling functionality of `pandas`; this are skills you'll be returning to throughout the semester.  In this assignment, you'll be expanding upon those skills by working with data from the City of Fort Worth's Open Data API.  As you learned in class, data APIs are interfaces that allow you to access data programmatically.  In turn, data APIs allow data to be accessed by applications such as websites, or in this case a data analysis pipeline.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Fort Worth's Open Data API is powered by [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com/), a start-up that helps cities open up their data catalogs to the public.  Many other cities, including [New York City](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/) and [Dallas](https://www.dallasopendata.com/), use Socrata as well.  Fort Worth's open data catalog is small, but growing, and the city's use of Socrata makes its data available in many different ways.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we'll be working with Fort Worth Police crime data, available at this link: https://data.fortworthtexas.gov/Public-Safety-Courts/Crime-Data/k6ic-7kp7.  The data include observations going back more than 100 years!  However, we'll be working with more recent data as we can presume that they are more complete.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Socrata web interface includes a lot of options for filtering, manipulating, and visualizing the data.  As we want to be able to access it inside our data analysis environment in `pandas`, however, we'll want to be able to access it directly.  Socrata gives several options for exporting the data in a variety of formats, including CSV; however, you are going to learn in this assignment how to access the data through Socrata's open data API.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, data APIs make data available in one of two formats: JSON (__J__ava__S__cript __O__bject __N__otation) or XML (e__X__tensible __M__arkup __L__anguage).  JSON is becoming the more common of the two, as it fits well within the structure of modern websites, which rely heavily on the JavaScript programming language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is a way of encoding data objects with JavaScript, and organizes data as a series objects represented by key-value pairs.  In terms of how you are used to thinking about data, the __object__ represents a record, the __key__ represents a column header, and the __value__ represents a data value.  Let's take a look at a single JSON record from the crime database (run the cell to display it if it doesn't show): "

Trust me, we haven't even scratched the surface of what the Notebook can do; it can display animated GIFs, YouTube videos, interactive charts/maps, and much more!  Here, I'm showing the contents of the URL https://data.fortworthtexas.gov/resource/k6ic-7kp7.json?case_no=63560 - click it to take a look if you want - which queries Fort Worth's open data API and returns a single record from the crime dataset.

This is the root directory of the data API; if you were to follow that link, you'd see the entire dataset in JSON format.  The second part, `?case_no=63560`, is a __filter__; the question mark signifies that I am going to query the data, and the string that follows, `case_no=63560`, specifies how the data are to be subsetted.  I've done this all in the URL of the API call!\n",

    "Additionally, the Socrata API recognizes a query language they call \"SoQL\", which operates against the API in a similar way to how SQL (Structured Query Language) allows users to access databases.

    "\n",
    "Data APIs are complicated topics and we're only scratching the surface here of what you can do with them.  In turn, your exercises for this assignment will be a little different.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your job here is to replicate the above analysis for __another type of offense__ and __another month__ (please note: the data only go up to July 2015) in Fort Worth.  Visit the Fort Worth dataset on the web here: https://data.fortworthtexas.gov/Public-Safety-Courts/Crime-Data/k6ic-7kp7 and look at the \"Offense_Desc\" column to see what other options there are.  Another note: some crimes like murder are relatively rare, so you might be better served choosing an offense that is more frequent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What this basically involves is re-using the code I've already written for this assignment, and modifying it slightly for your chosen type of offense and your chosen month.  To do this, you'll modify the API call at the beginning of the code accordingly.  I want you to get a sense of how you can \"change parameters\" in an API call, and in turn get different results.  Indeed, an enterprising analysis like this could wrap everything in a function and re-produce analyses by parameterizing these inputs in Python; you don't have to do that here, but hopefully this gives you a sense of why it is useful to write everything out with code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To get full credit for this assignment, your results should include responses to the following questions:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. How did crime incidents for your chosen offense in your chosen month vary by city council district?  \n",
    "2. Draw a chart that shows these variations.  \n",
    "3. How did crime rates per 1000 residents in your chosen month vary by city council district for your chosen offense?  \n",
    "4. Draw a chart that shows variations in rates by council district.  \n",
    "5. Draw a line chart that shows how incidents of your chosen offense varied by day in the month that you chose.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For full credit, this assignment is due by the end of the day on __Monday, November 2__.  \n"
