    "## Programming III: Loops, conditional statements, and object-oriented programming\n",

    "Welcome to your third and \"final\" notebook covering basic Python and programming concepts.  You'll be learning more ways to use Python over the course of the semester; however, this is the last notebook that directly emphasizes core programming skills.  This week's notebook will cover some additional topics that are essential to programming: loops, conditional statements, and object-oriented programming.  \n",

    "### Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, you will often want to do an operation multiple times, or carry out some process over a list of values that you've created.  To do this, you will frequently turn to __iterators__.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used iterators in Python are `for` and `while`.  A `for` loop carries out an action, or set of actions, for every element that you tell it to.  Let's give it a try in very simple terms.  I've created a list of teams in the Big 12 below; we'll loop through this list with `for` and concatenate another string to each element.  "

The first line of the loop - in this case `for team in big12` - is not indented, and is followed by a colon.  Everything else contained in the loop is found in an indented block on the line(s) following the `for` loop call.  As with functions, your loop will fail without proper indentation.  "

    "In the above lines of code, we used basic mathematical operators to see if conditions are true or false.  When we asked Python if 3 is greater than 2, it told us it was True; when we asked it if 2 is greater than 3, it said False.  Such true/false logic can be used with conditional statements in your code.  To do this, you'll often use __conditional operators__, which you'll be familiar with from basic mathematics, possibly with a couple exceptions.  Conditional operators in Python are as follows: \n",

    "* `<` Less than\n",

    "As humans, we use conditional logic all of the time without really thinking about it.  For example, __if__ I am hungry, I'll probably go eat something; otherwise, I won't.  Such logic can be expressed in Python as a series of `if`, `elif` (which means _else if_), and `else` statements.  \n",

    "Let's try to express this now in code in basic terms.  This is made-up code, so we don't need to understand everything, but here are the basics of it.  We define a function, `hungry`, that measures the biological/psychological properties that govern hunger reflexes in the human body.  We say, hypothetically, that a hunger index value encapsulating these properties that exceeds 100 means that a person is hungry; in turn, the function returns `True`.  Otherwise, it returns `False`.

While I am hungry, my level of hunger is not so debilitating that I am unable to work, and I know that finishing my work is a higher priority than eating at the moment.  In reality, there are countless conditions that influence whether we eat or not beyond simply how hungry we are.  For example - is there food accessible?  Are you in a place where it is socially acceptable to eat?  Perhaps you are at a party where pizza is available - you aren't hungry, but you eat it anyway?  Your brain processes all of this conditional logic at once as you make decisions, so we aren't always used to thinking explicitly about conditionals in such discrete ways.

    "__Exercise 4:__ Whenever you get new grades for your courses at TCU, your grade point average (GPA) needs to be updated accordingly.  GPA can be calculated rather simply; each grade is worth a given number of points, which are summed and divided by the total number of grades. Of course, it can get more complicated, taking into account things like credit hours - but we'll just keep it simple here.  \n",
