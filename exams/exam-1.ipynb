    "You're starting to get the hang of working with data in Python; now, it's time to put those skills to the test.  This is your first of three take-home examinations this semester, which are designed to evaluate your grasp of the concepts and techniques you're learning in this course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The take-home examinations will consist of a series of structured and semi-structured questions that you will answer with data analysis.  In this examination, you will answer __ten questions__ which pertain to two different datasets I've provided for you.  Each question will be worth __ten points__, giving a total possible score of 100; your scores will then be weighted as this take-home examination constitutes __15 percent__ of your overall course grade.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your responses to the following questions should consist of the following components: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code used to answer the question, and any results you've produced; \n",
    "2. Visualizations, when appropriate; \n",
    "3. A short write-up in Markdown explaining what you did, and analyzing/interpreting your results when appropriate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Responses to the questions that are \"correct\" will receive at least 7 out of the possible 10 points.  Responses that receive 8, 9, or 10 points will show evidence of effort beyond the minimum necessary to answer the question.  This could include but is not limited to noticeable thoughtfulness in the interpretation of the data; responses that blend computation, visualization, and description quite well; or evidence of going beyond the basic parameters of the assignment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This examination should be completed in this Jupyter Notebook, like your weekly assignments.  It is due by the end of the day on __Sunday, October 18__ for full credit, and will incur a 10 percent penalty (which is equivalent to one question!) for each day it is submitted past the deadline.  "
