## Assignment 1: Data journalism

As we discussed in class, data journalism represents reporting that includes interactive, data-driven content.  
Popular publications practicing data journalism include [The Upshot (New York Times)](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot), [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us), [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/), and many more.

Your task is to find an example of data journalism from the past five years in a __recognized publication__. Write a response that 1) summarizes the article, 2) discusses its data sources, and 3) discusses its methods of analysis and visualization.

Your response should be at least one paragraph, but no longer than four paragraphs.  Be sure to optimize your article selection; articles with limited content will give you less to write about!
