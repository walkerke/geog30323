    "Welcome to your first notebook of the semester!  Throughout the semester, you'll be using Jupyter Notebooks like this one to learn practical skills in data analysis.  The notebooks will consist of brief tutorials that reiterate some of the concepts you've learned in class, along with some basic exercises that test you on some of these skills.  Notebooks will be assigned most weeks during the semester, and are due the following week.  \n",

    "Much simpler!  Now, Python is not always going to be your language of choice for every application.  Python is an example of an _interpreted_ programming language, which means that it is converted on-the-fly to machine code - that is, code your computer can understand.  This can make development simpler, but generally executes slower than _compiled_ languages, in which the source code must be run through a compiler before it is executed.  This additional step, however, can speed up execution substantially, which is why compiled languages like Java, C, or C++ are sometimes preferred for software development.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python is an outstanding choice for data analysis, which is highly interactive and requires the testing of many different ideas on-the-fly.  Indeed, the Python community has built a robust infrastructure for data analysis with the language, which includes the Jupyter Notebook, which we are working in right now.  \n",

    "The Jupyter Notebook is an example of _literate programming_, in which documentation and computer code are tightly integrated.  The notebook itself is comprised of \"cells\" that either accept Python code, or text written in __Markdown__, a highly-simplified syntax for writing HTML code.  To choose a Python or Markdown cell, simply change the option from the drop-down menu at the top of the screen.  To \"run\" the contents of your cell, click the \"run cell\" button from the menu at the top of the screen, or use the keyboard shortcut Shift+Enter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tools like the Jupyter Notebook are an excellent way to document your workflow, and make your work reproducible.  Over the course of a data analysis, it is often challenging to remember every small step you have taken, or the rationale behind those steps.  With the notebook, you can include descriptions of your workflow along with the actual code you used to do your data analysis.  "
