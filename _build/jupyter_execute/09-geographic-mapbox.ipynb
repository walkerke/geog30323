    "## Assignment 9: Geographic visualization with Mapbox Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, the second-to-last of the semester, we will venture outside of the Python ecosystem to create interactive maps with Mapbox Studio.  You'll be making an interactive map of public intoxication violations in Fort Worth, drawn from the same City crime dataset you worked with in Assignment 7.  You'll explore methods for visualizing large amounts of point data and customize your map's appearance..  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance, you are going to upload a bulk CSV download that I've prepared for you from the City's open data catalog.  The data as currently constituted are not quite ready for use in Mapbox Studio, so we're going to clean it up a bit in `pandas` first.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Mapbox Studio accepts data in many formats, such as CSV, GeoJSON, and zipped shapefile.   In this instance, our data are in CSV format.  Let's read the data into `pandas` and have a look.  "

Click the \"Select data\" option once more (ensuring first that your intoxication layer is still selected) and click the __Type__ option.  From the options that appear, choose __Heatmap__.  Now, click __Style__ once more to style your data as a heatmap.  You'll note that your data no longer appears as points, but as a smoothed representation of where your points are concentrated.

Try zooming in and out on your map to see how the heatmap changes based on zoom level. \n",

To modify this, change the __Radius__ of your heatmap from the default 30 pixels and make it smaller.  Experiment with different radii and observe how the data representation changes on your map.\n",

I recommend the __viridis__ family of color palettes, which are built into __seaborn__ for quick lookup.  There are five palettes in the viridis family: `viridis`, `magma`, `inferno`, `plasma`, and `cividis`.  All are color-blind safe, perceptually uniform, and safe to print in black and white.

In Mapbox Studio, select the __Color__ option to style your heatmap and click on the color that represents the value 0.1 (\"royalblue\").  You should see an interactive color picker appear with options to modify the color values directly.  Choose one of the five color palettes I've printed and copy the first six-digit hexadecimal code in the printed list (you don't need the number sign as it is already provided) to the corresponding box with the number sign to the lower right of the interactive color picker.

Choose the __Opacity__ option and lower the value to make your heatmap layer semi-transparent.  You might also consider modifying the __Weight__ and __Intensity__ options to make your heatmap less intense.  Experiment with these different options until you achieve a representation that you like.  \n",

You may notice on the left-hand side of the screen that each element of the map - from map labels to roadways to water features - is represented in hierarchical order, with your heatmap layer sitting at the very top.  Click your intoxication layer in the layer list and drag it beneath all of the label layers (the last one listed is \"road-label\") and note how the visual hierarchy of your map changes, with labels above your heatmap."
